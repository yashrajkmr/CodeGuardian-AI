# CodeGuardian AI: Project Plan & Status

This document tracks the development progress, roadmap, and key decisions for the CodeGuardian AI project.

---
### ## Current Status (As of Oct 4, 2025)

- **Module 0: Setup:** COMPLETE.
  - Professional cloud-based environment in GitHub Codespaces is fully configured.

- **Module 1: Core Engine:** IN PROGRESS.
  - Basic FastAPI server with `/review-code` endpoint is functional.
  - **Blocker:** OpenAI account has an `insufficient_quota` error. Billing is required for real AI calls.

- **Module 3: Frontend UI:** LARGELY COMPLETE.
  - React + Vite project is set up with Mantine UI library.
  - Professional UI layout is built.
  - Full-stack communication is working: Frontend successfully calls the backend API.
  - Mock data is being served from the backend and rendered as a formatted table in the frontend.

### ## Project Roadmap

1.  **Module 2: Expand the AI Core:**
    - [ ] Implement Security & Performance prompts.
    - [ ] Create a final "Lead Engineer" synthesis prompt.

2.  **Module 3: Build the Frontend UI:**
    - [x] Build React components (input, button, output display).
    - [x] Connect the UI to the backend API.
    - [x] Use "mock" data until the billing issue is resolved.
    - [ ] Switch from mock data to real API data.

3.  **Module 4: GitHub App Integration:**
    - [ ] Create an official GitHub App.
    - [ ] Build a webhook handler in the backend.
    - [ ] Automate reviews on Pull Requests.

4.  **Module 5: Deployment & Polish:**
    - [ ] Deploy the backend to a cloud service (e.g., AWS).
    - [ ] Deploy the frontend to a cloud service (e.g., Vercel).
    - [ ] Finalize the main `README.md` with links and documentation.

### ## Immediate Next Step

- **Resolve the OpenAI billing (`insufficient_quota`) issue.** Once resolved, we will update the backend to make real API calls and switch the frontend to consume real data.
